# saga-login-flow

> A login/register flow built with React & Redux Saga

This application demonstrates what a React-based register/login workflow might look like with [redux-saga](https://github.com/yelouafi/redux-saga).

It's based on Max Stoiber's [login-flow](https://github.com/mxstbr/login-flow), but uses redux-saga instead of redux-thunk to handle asynchronous actions.
